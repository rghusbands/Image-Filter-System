#Image Filters

A C/C++ projected. Final version is C++. Read pnm images into an array of pixels.
Applied different algorithms to the pixel array to give different filter options.

In order to run:

make

make run

-You can then look at my_output.png to see result.

-Can also look at Makefile to see what make and make run do.
